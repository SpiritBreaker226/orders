# Cloudkitchens Interview Challenge

## Background

At City Storage Systems, we assist in the production and fulfillment of online food orders. In the process of creating and delivering these orders, some common workflows involve processing and displaying large amounts of order events — when orders are placed, prepared, delivered, etc. These orders and events can be displayed on interfaces used by cooks, delivery drivers, in-house engineers, and more. You will be building a (simulated) system to help facilitate this.

## Challenge Prompt

Build an in-browser application that displays Orders in real-time as they are delivered from a provided server API, and allows users to search their Orders by price.

During the deep dive following the challenge, we’ll check out your real-time simulation in action, collaboratively explore your code, and augment, fix, and iterate on your solution together.
